TimeCalc is a scratch pad for converting between various date formats and making calculations with dates
and durations. Expressions are entered in the left pane and their values are displayed in the right pane. One
expression per line. Comments start with # and run to the end of the line. Datetimes, durations and arithmetic
operations on them are supported. Whenever the text on the left is modified the results on the right are
recalculated.
