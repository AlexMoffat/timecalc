TimeCalc provides a service called `Convert Datetime` in the `Development` section of the Services Preferences panel.
Bind this to a key combination to send selected text to TimeCalc for parsing, starting it if it's not already running. This makes
it very quick to highlight a string in an app or on a page, for example from a log message, and get it into TimeCalc is a
standard format.
