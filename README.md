TimeCalc is an OS X scratch pad for time and date calculations. You can enter dates, times and durations in different formats,

## Features / Functionality / Help

All of the features and functions are describe in the help files in markdown format in the [_English.lproj](TimeCalcHelp/_English.lproj) directory or visible from the `Help` menu in the app.

## Building

The only requirement beyond Xcode is [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which is used together with the [Jekyll Apple Help](https://github.com/chuckhoupt/jekyll-apple-help) templates to  generate the OS X help docs. You can just follow the [jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install jekyll.
